# A Whale Off the Port(folio)[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Kowsi/Quantitative-Portfolio-Analysis/master)

## Background

The investment division of Harold's company has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best. Here we are going to see how we are going to solve the challenges using our technical knowledge.

We learned these quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, so here we are going to determine which portfolio is performing the best across many areas: **volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.**

We created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. Given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds.  And then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500).


Three main tasks:

1. [Read in and Wrangle Returns Data](#Prepare-the-Data)
2. [Determine Success of Each Portfolio](#Conduct-Quantitative-Analysis)
3. [Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio](#Custom-Portfolio)


**File:** [Whale Analysis Code](whale_analysis.ipynb)

### Prepare the Data

First, We read and clean several CSV files for analysis. The CSV files include whale portfolio returns, algorithmic trading portfolio returns, and S&P 500 historical prices. 

### Conduct Quantitative Analysis

Below We analyzed the data to see if any of the portfolios outperform the stock market (i.e., the S&P 500).

#### Performance Analysis

1. Calculate and plot cumulative returns. **Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?**

> Yes, `BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC` and `Algo 1`

Stock | Cumulative returns
------------ | -------------
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC  | 0.527786
Algo 1 | 0.690246
SP 500 | 0.364329
    
    


#### Risk Analysis

1. Create a box plot for each of the returns. **Which box has the largest spread? Which has the smallest spread?**

> Largest spread - `TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC` <br/>
> Smallest spread - `PAULSON & CO.INC.`

2. Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio. **Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500?**

> `TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC`    
> `BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC`        

#### Rolling Statistics

1. Plot the rolling standard deviation of the firm's portfolios along with the rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500. **Does the risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?**

> Yes, almost all the stock's risk increases at the same time risk increases in the S&P except `Tiger Global Management LLC`

2. Construct a correlation table for the algorithmic, whale, and S&P 500 returns. **Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?**

> `Algo 2` & `SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC` are most closely mimic the S&P

3. Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. **Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?**

> `BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC` seems more sensitive to S&P 500

#### Plot Sharpe Ratios

Investment managers and their institutional investors look at the return-to-risk ratio, not just the returns. (After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return, yet one is lower risk, you would invest in the lower-risk portfolio, right?)

1. Using the daily returns, calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot.

2. **Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.**

> Yes, `Algorithmic strategies` **outperformed** S&P 500 and the whales portfolios

### Custom Portfolio Analysis

Harold is ecstatic that you were able to help him prove that the algorithmic trading portfolios are doing so well compared to the market and whales portfolios. However, now you are wondering whether you can choose your own portfolio that performs just as well as the algorithmic portfolios. 

1. Combining custome portfolio returns to the DataFrame with the other portfolios and rerun the analysis. **How does custom portfolio fair?**

> `Custom portfolio` is doing well compared with Whales and S&P 500, just like Algorithmic trading porfolios
